So I wanted to stop these social media accounts since a long time, for many reasons, but most importantly because it makes me sad and confused about what I am doing in this world, especially when it comes to my work, my artistic practice. So I decided to take charge of my own archive and history making, as far as thats possible. Because archiving is very important! (◔◡◔✿)

So from now on I will share something that is going on right now, looking into the future or sharing the process. Every post will be followed by a recap from my artistic history. In this way I will stay connected to my previous work, and have the opportunity to reflect on past events, something that I otherwise rarely do. So thats a good combo I think! Happy reading!

NOW
Im siting in my studio office in Berlin. Im sharing a very beautiful room with my friend [Kaj] () and my partner [Andreas] (). Its extremely cosy! Looking through the window I see the Chinese wisteria (Blåregn på svenska), all green and fluffy. There are still some flowers left, but the blooming is over since some time. 

At the moment Im preparing my recording device for this weekends interviews in Copenhagen. Me and my friend and colleague Anna Jakobsson are meeting six composers and sound artists from south of Sweden and Denmark to talk about what is inspiring and moving them in their artistic practice. We will record all these meetings and this will then become a part of a sound installation that [Konstmusiksystrar]() will present at [VBKÖ]() - Vereinigung Bildender Künstlerinnen Österreichs (Austrian Association of Women Artists) in Vienna later this year.

THEN
In January 2019 the piece [“Gentle Acts”]() was premiered by [Passepartout Duo]() in Italy. Since then they have performed it so so so so many times and all around this world, I cant believe how great they are and what a strange and incredible feeling it is to have a piece of music traveling around the world, without me! Its like flying or teleportation, or as if Im expanding. The piece is based on a poem by the Swedish poet, artist and writer Channa Riedel with whom I was in collaborating with for this piece. Channa is so cool, colourful, brave and sharp, and her poem had great influence on the music. The title of this piece is inspired by writings of feminist scholar [Donna Haraway](). 
Here is a [radio](http://1trackpodcast.com/1-track-contemporary-classical-podcast-passepartout-duo-s7e10/) show where Passepartout Duo are talking about this piece. 
In general Im so grateful for the possibility of working together with so good people and artists, “Gentle Acts” is a piece and experience that still warms my heart! <3 <3 <3
